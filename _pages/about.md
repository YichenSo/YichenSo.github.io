I'm a second-year [Ph.D. student at Boston University Center for Computing and Data Sciences](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/explore/bu-center-for-computing-data-sciences/) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Aldo Pacchiano](https://www.aldopacchiano.ai/). Previously, I did my master in the [Robotics Department at the University of Michigan](https://robotics.umich.edu/). I also spent time in [Honda Research Institute US](https://usa.honda-ri.com/) as a Research Intern in Summer 2022

My research focuses on Sequential Decision Making, particularly in the areas of Reinforcement Learning and Bandits. I am especially interested in developing and analyzing adaptive algorithms that perform well in non-stationary environments.
